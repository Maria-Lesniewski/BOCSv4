CGFF ToolKit

#Nick Dunn 9/24/14

This is the (currently untitled) Noid Group CGFF toolkit. It includes the previously
separate tools for mapping an atomistic trajectory, running the cgff calculation, and
generating useful gromacs table files.  In order to build this on the lionx clusters,
follow these steps:


$ mkdir build

$ cd build

$ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=build

$ make


And the executables you want should be located in build/bin.  I'm working to make this
more general (enable non-mpi builds, build in different environments).  For now, this
is a significant improvement over the previous makefiles.

Pressure Matching Toolkit

#Nick Dunn 10/13/16

This is the (currently untitled) Noid Group pressure matching toolkit. 
In order to build this on the lionx clusters, follow these steps:


$ mkdir build

$ cd build

$ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=build

$ make


And the executables you want should be located in build/bin.  I'm working to make this
more general (enable non-mpi builds, build in different environments).  For now, this
is a significant improvement over the previous makefiles.
